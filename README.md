## A brief story about me 🤏🏽

   ### I'm from 1989, i grew up as a computer kid, my father is a programmer, so i've always been in touch with computer and internet, where i learned english, spanish, editing video, audio and image, by myself. At 1st grade of high school i studied at a computer technology school, there i learned fundamental programming logic, which i had excellent grades, but the school was changing location and i had to change school. <br />After i finished high school i attended to a Java SE course, but was young and a bit stupid, at the time, then i decided that i didn't want to become a programmer and i went to civil engineering college, at half of the course, a north american network marketing company was introduced to me. I decided to get millionaire with network marketing, despite my efforts and the good results i got at the company, i didn't get millionaire and it was no longer worth it to continue putting my efforts in this type of business, even more considering everything i was losing, it ended up taking me one year of college. <br />It wasn't a bad experience, at the time, i've invested in my personal development, i took some courses in sales and leadership development based on neurolinguistic programming. The final result of all this is that i lost the chance to finish the college and the invesment made in the company. <br />In the following years, life gifted me with a kid, and i decided to become the father of two girls, to fulfill my parenting responsabilities i worked as cook assistant, waiter and App driver. I worked as driver for almost 3 years, during this time i got full of ideas of apps to help drivers, and interested in game programming too, then i started studying some free courses, at internet, when i had time, but you have no free time when you work 12-16h/day, and soon i gave up the programming studies (my vocation), and focused on studying for public contests, between a passenger and another (for my parenting responsabilities), also in 2019 i started a Law graduation at Fadergs University, but the pandemic came, when i lost the job, due to lockdown, and the car which i was renting. <br />At the first year of pandemic i studied to serve as municipal civil guard, i got approved to serve in the city i was living, Gravataí-RS, but the brazilian economic situation ended up complicating a call for new civil servants. During this time, that i was studying for guard i started to get back at the programming studies, even more so that Unity had released all its courses for free on the internet, but that wasn't the focus and i was taking it as a "hobby" for spare time. At the start of this year, waiting for the calling from public tender with the local news saying that the new mayor wouldn't call new servants, i decided to get back at programming studies, and i've been working a small portfolio to show off. <br />But now, to put all my ideas into practice, without going back, because I've always felt that software development is something I like. <br /> I've been jumping from one branch to another, all this time (once by the stupidity of a young man, others by need), but i never quit studying, it was always a lack of money that prevented me from finishing my studies, now i have a plan to follow. <br />I learned all of this here 👇🏾, within less than a year, imagine everything we can achieve together!!💥💥
